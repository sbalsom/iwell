  "I have a doctorate in psychology and am a diploma candidate in analytical psychology at the C.G. Jung Institute Zurich. I am a registered intern of the European Board of Licensed Professional Counselors & Therapists and abide by the Board's Code of Ethics and supervision requirements. \n\n My interest in psychological health began in the early 1980s, and I have been studying, practicing, and working in the field since then. \n\n I obtained my Masters degree in counseling, and have continued to learn as new knowledge in the field unfolds. I have engaged in significant personal growth, which offers an added layer of understanding to my work.  \n\n \n\n My goal is to help you understand yourself, use your inner wisdom and your strengths. I encourage compassionate treatment of self, which can greatly enhance the healing process. I use both thought- and body-based approaches, such as cognitive behavior therapy, EMDR and somatic work. I can weave in spirituality and creativity, as clients are interested. This can bring deeper meaning and a richness to life.",
  "Did you know you could change your brain to change your mind? Through the therapeutic relationship and various techniques including Biofeedback, Neurofeedback, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy, you can change your brain and change your relationship to yourself and others.\n\n I adapt my modalities based on individual needs and situations. I am trained in CBT, DBT, and take a humanistic/existential approach. I enjoy art therapy, play therapy and being creative/open-minded with the therapeutic process.",
  "My job is to provide a safe holding space for you to become more aware of the obstacles in the way of your own healing and growth. This includes any obstacle that keeps you from coming to therapy. Please call, email , or text me so I can help. \n\n Though originally trained in family systems with a CBT and Group orientation, I have added from Jungian, self-psychology, internal family systems, and addictions training (including eating disorders and alcohol). I am comfortable working with people who take psychiatric medication or people who have medical conditions. I appreciate collaboration with primary care providers. \n\n I am certified in mediation, using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and Gottman couples therapy.",
  "Productive therapy and life change happens when a solid, trusting relationship forms between client and therapist. My greatest strength as a therapist is forming that bond quickly with my clients so that we can identify and address the problem(s) together. \n\n I believe people have an innate capacity to learn and grow. Therapy offers fertile ground for you to safely explore the rich depth of your inner life and focus on what stands in the way of being who you want to be. We will collaborate to understand your unique emotions, mind, body, and history as the process of healing unfolds. Making sense of who you are, individually and in relationship, enhances your ability to make wise choices about your life. I believe creativity is available to all of us and enjoy working with clients who like to engage their own creative process in any form.",
  "As a therapist, I consider it an honor to be a part of my clients journey as they develop insight, create change, and identify goals. Life can bring up challenging and painful situations that can make us feel lost or stuck. My goal is to provide you with the tools you need to get to a better place. \n\n My treatment approach is eclectic and tailored to your needs. I will listen carefully and without judgment to understand your unique challenges, strengths and hopes. Healing and growth become possible through an accepting, trusting, collaborative relationship. We will use our understanding of your development, temperament, communication and relational style, and coping skills to understand the causes of your distress and what treatment works best for you. My work style ranges from insight oriented discussions to more structured activities, depending on your needs. \n\n  Over the years my private practice work has been enhanced through specialized advanced training in Psychodynamic Psychotherapy and Developmental/Attachment based Psychotherapy with adults as well as participation in ongoing professional consultation and reading groups.",
  "I think counseling is always useful, even when there's nothing wrong We get a lot of chances to go, go, go but not a lot to slow down and reflect. Usually it takes some crisis of feeling or relationship to tell us it's time. I see those crises as opportunities, doorways to deeper understanding. \n\n My clients feel accepted and nourished. They feel like I get them. They have found a place where they can be themselves. We start with awareness in the present moment and go from there. As they explore and express their tender emotions - the shame and pain diminishes to uncover the needs hidden underneath. In claiming those needs and accepting their own vulnerability, my clients carve a path which frees them to make choices that bring joy and fulfillment into their lives. This healing allows them to be true to themselves. \n\n In 2010, I trained in Interpersonal Neurobiology with Dan Seigel & attended an IPNB & Mindfulness workshop with Jack Kornfield & Dan Seigel. I study mindfulness by following the teachings of Pema Chodron, Jack Kornfeld, Tara Brach, Jon Kabat Zinn, & James Baraz. I also have a meditation practice.",
  "I believe strongly in the human potential for growth and change especially during times of difficulty and personal crisis. I believe that every problem presents us with an opportunity, as we often resist that which we need to learn most. \n\n We will work collaboratively to reach your goals and move at a pace that is comfortable for you. My work is based on non-pathologizing and empowering methods drawing from theories such as Jungian and Internal Family Systems. Integrating these theoretical perspectives allows for exploration of your inner world, better understanding of Self, and helps you to develop a richer story of your life. Using creative modalities such as imagery, metaphors, journaling, sand tray and dream work are powerful healing tools that encourages the integration of body, mind and soul. Together we will utilize effective strategies that will help you develop the capacity to release old wounds and gain health and wellness. \n\n I specialize in working with adult children of narcissists; helping them to understand and heal from their past, set boundaries, break patterns, and learn to trust themselves and others in order to have happier and healthier relationships.",
  "I use a straight-forward supportive approach, building on strengths to develop needed resources. I value diversity in my part time practice. I also have a salaried position working with physicians and their families. Sliding fee may be an option. \n\n My approach to therapy is to build a collaborative, creative relationship with you that encourages you to identify and engage your own inner wisdom and resilience to face life’s challenges. By supporting you to cultivate curiosity and compassion towards yourself and your experience, I hope to help you achieve the positive change and movement in your life that you seek. I have a particular passion for helping couples increase intimacy and security in their relationships. The model of couples therapy that I work with most is PACT (psychobiological approach to couples therapy). This approach developed by Stan Tatkin (Wired for Love) integrates the latest research in attachment, neuroscience, and arousal regulation. It focuses on helping couples become experts on each other to improve communication and deepen your understanding of your partner and yourself. \n\n I have been licensed as a Marriage and Family Therapist since 2010. I've been in the field providing counseling and psychotherapy for over 10 years. I've worked with teens, individuals, couples, and groups in a variety of clinic environments and private practice. I also worked for many years at Hospice providing counseling to terminally ill patients and their families during the dying process.",
  "I am a down-to-earth therapist, who brings my genuine self, and a spirit of openness to my relationships. Areas of focus include supporting the LGBTQ+ community and offering financial therapy to individuals & couples. A strength of mine is noticing and building upon the strengths of others. \n\n I draw from Systemic, Emotionally-Focussed, Cognitive Behavioral and Narrative theories in my work. I begin therapy with creating a warm relationship as I get to know your current concern and past relationships. I investigate context and offer alternatives to unsatisfying patterns as we use current life examples and plan for long-term goals. \n\n I have worked with individuals, couples and families in a variety of settings from residential treatment to research. My ongoing studies have included courses in Interpersonal Neurobiology, the Gottman Method and Emotionally Focused Therapy. \n\n\n\n Using an integrative approach grounded in humanistic theory, I facilitate a process of personal discovery, emotional healing and continued growth. I maintain a strengths-based style that empowers individuals to follow their self-direction and to make effective changes in their lives.",
  "I view counseling as a joint partnership between a counselor and client and I listen carefully to the concerns of my clients. I am passionate about creating a safe environment for you to explore and heal from pasts pain, while also discovering purpose and meaning in your life. I use an integrated approach to counseling, which means that I am willing to apply creativity and various types of interventions that may benefit you. I love to work with clients from all orientations and walks of life. I have a background in working with individuals and groups who have spiritual concerns, however, out of care and respect for my clients, I will never impose my personal beliefs or opinions onto clients. I immigrated to the US two decades ago, so I can relate to the difficulties many people face in adapting to a new country, language, and culture \n\n I am trained to meet the unique needs of clients who are survivors of domestic and intimate partner violence. I also have many years of experience helping clients with challenging relationships, addiction, food struggles, trauma, anxiety, depression, bipolar., spiritual issues, and cultural challenges.",
  "Hi! I am Dr. Julia Rosch, a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor (LCPC) in the state of Illinois. I earned my graduate degree in Clinical and Community Mental Health in Illinois and earned my Doctorate degree (PhD) in General Psychology. I provide therapy services, specializing in anxiety and depression. I have experience working with individuals, couples and families.",
  "I genuinely care for the well-being of others, and I have the ability to fully support each person I counsel. In addition to traditional therapy, I offer wilderness immersion counseling and outdoor therapy services throughout all of Europe. \n\n I provide individuals, families, couples and teens the opportunity to safely and confidently explore your life experiences and help you feel whole and well. My therapy practice offers an opportunity to become accepting and empowered about your life experience, your behavior and choices. I offer thoughtful, collaborative, compassionate, client-centered therapy. Part of my practice includes calling attention to how the body is responding to narrative, discussion, emotion and using skills of breathwork and sometimes physical movement to allow the body to feel safe in the therapy process. \n\n I am dedicated to offering an ethical and compassionate trauma-informed, somatic-integrated, honest, thoughtful and unconditional counseling experience.",
  "I have been studying human behavior and interactions ever since I can remember. First, in my family and through literature. I became interested in Eastern Philosophy in high school and that has influenced my psychotherapy approach. \n\n I approach my work with five things in mind. I strive to develop a strong therapeutic relationship with you. I meet you where you are in life, welcoming you to bring your authentic self to session. I help you identify and clarify problems and challenges. I help you build and hone new skills, patterns of thought, and ways of being. Finally, we bring it all together so you can solve problems and create meaningful and lasting changes. I find value in using a variety of counseling theories and techniques, but specialize in cognitive behavioral therapy and integrating creative and active pursuits into counseling, including ceramics and hiking. Getting out of the office and into a studio or out in nature helps develop the therapeutic relationship, impacts our experience, and opens different modes of communication. \n\n ",
  "Do you struggle to cope with intense emotion? Are you triggered by small, unforeseeable incidents? It may feel like your life is in shambles, but you can cope. As an LGBT+ affirming counselor, I work with you to learn how to access your inner resources so that you may live a mindful, healthy life. \n\n Depending on your needs and goals, I offer brief problem-solving therapy and/or longer-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. By design, I have maintained a broad-based practice, welcoming clients with many presenting concerns. However, some of my areas of special expertise include: Adoption (including adoption consultation & work with all members of adoption triad) Anxiety including AlphaStim Assertiveness Attachment and attachment issues Communication Considering parenthood (for single people, same sex couples, older parents) Couples therapy Depression Divorce/separation FASD Family of origin issues Fertility and infertility Gender identity Giftedness Grief and loss Jewish identity Life transitions LGBTQ+ identified Parenting concerns (including one's own issues playing out in parenting).",
  "Are you struggling with some overwhelming issues in your life? I would love to help you overcome your obstacles, take control of your life and live it to the full. Let's collaborate together to help you reach your goals. \n\n Being resilient allows you to recover and adapt to difficult experiences. Instead of being overwhelmed, the resilient person is able to manage their strong feelings and impulses and communicate their concerns and needs. Resilience is not a trait that you either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that can be learned and developed in all of us. Couples who are resilient are open, attuned, and responsive to each other. They are able to recognize their deepest needs and longings, and risk reaching out to their partner to communicate and connect. Most often, couples who develop an enhanced emotional connection also experience greater intimacy and sexual satisfaction.",
  "I am a positive and nurturing person, bringing heart and soul into my work. Together we will find creative solutions to complicated problems and help you feel empowered and optimistic about the challenges you face. Please email me to schedule a free 20 minute phone consultation. \n\n My approach to working with children, teens and adults is eclectic and guided by the needs of my client. I have training and experience in cognitive-behavioral, DBT, brief solution-focused, motivational interviewing and narrative therapies. I also use Collaborative Problem Solving in addressing behavioral and communication issues.",
  "Each person seeking counseling deserves to be seen and respected as an individual, and the counseling process must reflect this individuality. It is my job as a counselor to help my clients plan and use their personal strengths, resources, and supports to find new ways to live. \n\n I am trained in Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), and my passion is working with intimate partners and individuals who are struggling with relationship dynamics. My work is rooted in attachment and family systems theories, supporting my understanding of how everything is relational. I invite you to show up no matter what form your relationship takes as we work to heal and strengthen your relationship bond. \n\n In addition to my ongoing EFT training, I have a background in trauma recovery work as well as working with individuals and their families impacted by chronic illness.",
  "The problem is on one side of the table, you and I sit on the other. I’ve got your back. I also tools and evidenced-based practices to support the process. \n\n I use an integrative approach to therapy by blending somatic, person-centered (humanistic), internal family systems, narrative, and acceptance-commitment therapy, all with the goal of providing an individually tailored approach for each client and situation. \n\n My therapeutic approach allows me to effectively serve people dealing with trauma, grief and loss, difficult life transitions, anxiety, depression, substance use issues, and integrating experiences of non-ordinary states of consciousness.",
  "Decision coaching, career counseling, personal productivity coaching, strategic planning and achieving goals. Specialites: lifestyle and career choices; change and transitions; leadership and team decisions, time-management and productivity. \n\n I believe that we are comprised of psychological, physiological, relational and spiritual facets that are all interrelated. Therefore, an integrated counseling approach will help understand your story to bring awareness to the many facets that make up your varying identities. I work from a systems perspective that helps to uncover how your family-of-origin and past experiences have shaped the person you are today. I work with individuals and couples on issues related to anxiety, depression, grief/loss, relationships, codependency, trauma, life transitions, infertility, self-worth/identity and communication skills.",
  "I specialize in working with adults searching for meaning and clarity as they contemplate making life changes. These changes can cause anxiety, which we immediately want to suppress, but what if we used anxiety to fuel curiosity about our lives? \n\n I work from a client-centered and integrative foundation.

I work from a place of deep empathy, understanding, intuition, and humor -- I also draw from an extensive array of counseling theories and tools to create a relevant and productive therapeutic environment for personal growth and positive change.
